              numerous small personal website building projects. I am particularly

              of user experience (UX) design principles."

              " I have worked on a project called Sensing LDR using FPGA, this
              project is related to hardware. Our project model counts the
              number of persons entered and left a building.So it upcounts when
              people enter through the model and downcounts when people leave
              through it.By this porject I have gained lot of experience in
              controlling and managing FPGA device and I was team-lead in the
              project by which I got to know LeaderShip qualities and how to
              manage things."
